* cURL (mPAY24 API)
* DOM (mPAY24 API)
* Mcrypt (mPAY24 API)
* [WooCommerce Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) v2.0 or higher

= Manual installation =

1. Upload `woocommerce-gateway-mpay24` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Configure your mPAY24 settings under `WooCommerce Settings -> Checkout -> mPAY24`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which payment methods does the plugin support? =

The plugin supports all payment methods available with mPAY24. It pulls the payment methods from your mPAY24 merchant account and shows all on the payment page.

= How can I change the styling of the payment page? =

Since version 1.3 there are styling options on the gateway settings page. Basic CSS knowledge is required for this. Some basic changes on the default mPAY24 stylings are implemented as default values. One rule for styling: You are not allowed to send markup with urls to external (not mPAY24 hosted files) files (e.g. background images).

= I get an permission error for writing in mPAY24 folder? =

If you enable logging in the gateway settings then the curl operations will write a `curllog.log` in the MPay24 folder of the plugin. Please make this file or the whole folder writable for the webserver.

= How to get the current MDXI.xsd from mPAY24? =

If a transaction is done, mPAY24 sometimes sends a newer version of the MDXI.xsd file which is located in the MPay24 folder. Make sure that this file can be written by the webserver.

= The transaction is successful in payment page but in woocommerce the order status is cancelled. What's wrong? =

Maybe you have an .htaccess protection (HTTP authentication) on your wordpress site. That's why mPAY24 cannot access the success url to send the right transaction status. Removing HTTP authentication should solve the problem. Since version 1.4 you can put your HTTP authentication credentials in the gateway settings so that mPAY24 can send the right transaction status.
